## Assumptions and Workings

- We Can create only  disks and  files with unique name in each disk

- writing in file can be stopped by giving 'stop' in next line

- Deleting a file from disk also closes the corresponding file descriptor if it is open.

- We Can store a max of 100 files in the disk and each block in the disk is of size 50KB

- Read, Write and Append operations will work only if file is opened in corresponding mode.
